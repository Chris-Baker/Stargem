  -- add a bunch of tasks
  
  -- minebots are pretty dumb they just sit there until you get near to them
  
  -- then they stand up playing an animation 
  
  -- and walk towards you
  
  -- when they get near they attack which makes them explode after a timer
  -- this plays a sound and an animation then replaces the entity with an explosion
  -- entity and a trigger which does damage to players
